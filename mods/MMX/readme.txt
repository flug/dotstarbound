Installation:
Unzip the MMX folder into your starbound/mods/ folder.

The Tabula Rasa mod is required (v1.4): http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/the-tabula-rasa.114/

Bugs:
The X-Buster and the muzzle effects are overlapped by the front hand - theres nothing i can do about this - its a (hopefully) temporarily engine limitation of SB.


Please don't use any of these assets/sprites in any other project without asking us. None of the assets were ripped from any Mega Man game,
but they are heavily inspired by them.
