This mod adds gravity guns from Half Life™
They are basically a better version of a matter manipulator.

note:
Sometimes when you save and quit you get errors and it crashes.
I currently don't know how to fix this. Sorry!
(The game still saves, but it exits instead of going into main menu)
The whole mod still works even if that happens.
Thank you for your patience while I try to fix this.
