Description:

This mod is about to add some Mass Effect flavor to Starbound.
It adds a new custom race called N7Human, who gets the SSV Normandy SR-1
from Mass Effect as starter ship.
With future updates it will also add custom items, materials etc. I have a very long idea
list so far ;)
If the ship upgrade system is implemented in starbound I will add a new mass effect starter ship (maybe an alliance shuttle or an alliance fighter) and the normandy SR-2

The Normandy is empty right now, it contains only the basic ship equipment. But new things will be added with the next updates.

Features:
- Normandy SR1
- Special Normandy interior materials and objects
- Omni-Tool (replaces the matter manipulator)
- Omni-Blade (replaces the starter sword)
- N7 Shiplocker
- N7 Techstation
- CIC Stations (decorative)
- N7 Captains' Chair


Possible Conflicts:
If you use a mode with the same tile/material ids there will be a conflict.

I used following tile/material ids:
7001 n7 ship wall
7002 n7 ship detail
