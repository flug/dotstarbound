Phase 3:

This update contains all three parts of the Varia armor for both male and female characters!

Also included is the Gravity armor. This is just a recolour, think of it as thanks for putting up with the wait.

This release fixes the animation of the bsleeve shoulder. This should now animate as intended.

Does what it says on the tin.

To install, drag the full folder folder into your steam/steamapps/common/Starbound/mods directory.

!!IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED EARLIER VERSIONS!!

If you've installed an earlier version, firstly, thank you, and secondly: Please delete all Hox_ folders in your assets/items/armors/other and assets/recipes/armor/other directories, as this will cause Starbound to get stuck loading forever.

You can craft both sets from the Anvil/Metalworking station for 10 pixels each.

LEGAL/whatever

I don't own the Metroid series or any of the stuff in it, all I did was create crude sprites for fun. No profit is made etc. Nintendo own Metroid/Samus etc.

Ask before adding to distributed mod packs etc.
